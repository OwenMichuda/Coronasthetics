# Coronasthenics

Given the recent events, I spend the large majority of my time inside, in my room, laying on my bed. I am a very active 
person, but with all the gyms being closed, I have found myself slacking off and skipping workouts. To combat this, I 
downloaded an app that focuses on home workouts, but it is riddled with advertisements and I never feel fully satisfied
 the way I did when I was going to the gym. That's why I want to build my own application that develops the workout plan
  to exactly what I want, instead of following other people's plans.

I have no access to any gym equipment, so this project will only include calisthenic workouts, hence the name. The
 vision I have in mind is to input what workout I want, such as legs, core, or arms, and I want it to return a video of
  a model that does the full workout plan with me. This way it will keep me on pace for the times I should be doing the
   exercises in. I am committed to seeing this project through because it will help me stay on track in my physicality
    during these hard times.

As for external libraries, I was thinking of using SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) again so I could have a
 database with entries such as what workouts I did, when I did them, what specific exercises, how long each workout took,
  etc. A general schedule for the project would be:
* Week 1
  * Plan out the exercises I want, the appropiate number of each exercise for a workout.
  * Develop code that generates a workout plan based off user inputs.
* Week 2
  * Work on database that stores the past workouts and all of the statistics. 
* Week 3
  * Implement video that keeps user on track with time.
  * If time permits, add animation videos that showcase the current exercise.

If I were to finish the project early, I could implement other features such as difficulty, where it scales the number
 of exercises based on how difficult I want the workout to be. I'm sure there are other small features I could add as
  well.
