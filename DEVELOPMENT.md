# Development
- **4/21/20** Set up the initial framework
    - Added the external libraries
    - There are still a few kinks to work out but it works
    - Created a couple classes that represent an exercise, a plan, etc.

    - I spent the majority of this day trying to figure out what the problem was with the exercise database.
